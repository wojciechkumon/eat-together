# EatTogether 

Want to cook something amazing and share with others? Do you want to meet friends and eat something new? Help the environment and don’t waste food anymore! Do you have some specific food preferences or intolerance? Meet foodie friends like you!

We are going to create the application which allows you to invite hungry people and cook meals for them. “Chef” can prepare dishes, which always wanted to cook, and never had a chance to do that (whole roasted duck for one person?). Guest can eat valuable homemade dishes cheaper than at the restaurant. All of the users will contribute and gain profits.

This application will be also used by tourists who want to enjoy local cuisine. They will be able to choose from a variety of different dishes prepared by “native chefs”.

Users will be able to:
- create “meal events”, set number of participants, set time and date and localization
- split cost of meals inside the application
- search for “meal events” by criteria such as cuisine type, localization, price range, “chef” rating
- create the user profile with cooking preferences

Our solution will fill the gap in the sharing economy world. It will solve many important problems of the modern world such as:
- food waste
- choosing low-quality food over homemade meals
- according to medical research, eating alone will make you more depressed
